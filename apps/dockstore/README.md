### DockMon ([source](https://github.com/its4nik/dockstat/tree/main/apps/dockstore/src/content/plugins/dockmon))

DockMon is the default Metrics collector for DockStat. It works by listening on 'container:metrics' and 'host:metrics' events emitted by the DockerClientManager. It stores the metrics in a database and provides a REST API to query the metrics. These endpoints can also be used by other Plugins

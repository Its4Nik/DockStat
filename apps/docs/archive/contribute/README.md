## Submitting Templates

When submitting a new template:


1. Create a new folder in the `template/` directory named after the stack (e.g., `redis`, `nginx`), please only use lowercase letters.
2. Add the required files:
   * `**schema.json**`: Follows the repository's JSON schema format.
   * `**README.md**`: Describes the stack, its use, and configuration options.
   * `**DESCRIPTION.md**`: A short description for the stack (max 50 characters).
3. Ensure your files are formatted correctly:
   * Validate `schema.json` using a JSON schema validator.
   * Ensure `README.md` is clear, concise, and well-structured.
